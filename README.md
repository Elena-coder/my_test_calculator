# my_test_calculator
This program serves as a calculator.   
The first release (see tag ex1) operates through the command line.    
Upon a quick introduction after a user enters 2 numbers and the chooses a mathematical operation the program calculates the result.

The second release (see tag ex1_v.1.1) uses GUI.   
Upon a quick introduction the program offers to choose between 3 options: 1, 2 or nothing.  
* If the user chooses 1 he/she sees an interactive window containing a textfield (asking his/her mood) and checkbox (asking readiness to test the calculator). 
Based on the user's answer a dialog box is shown repeating the text which was entered by the user into the textfield.  
* If the user chooses 2 he/she sees a calculator with a textfield and 16 buttons. 
The calculator can be used as a normal calculator (options of adding, substracting, multiplying and dividing are possible).  
* If the user chooses nothing (just presses the Enter button) the program is finished.
